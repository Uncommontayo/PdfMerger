      "manage them by the use of the appropriate controls.\n",
      "There are three main types of control:\n",
      " yphysical – for example locks on doors and secure cabinets;\n",
      " yprocedural – for example checking references for job applicants; \n",
      " yproduct/technical controls – for example passwords or encryption.\n",
      "The latest version of the ISO 27001 standard contains 133 controls within 39 functional \n",

      "subject of controls is an almost bottomless pit. All we can do here is to explain the \n",
      "principles of the generic use of the major controls within information security that  deal \n",
      "with procedures and people. More detailed information about specific controls is outside \n",

      "Learning outcomes\n",
      "Information assurance  is a lot more than just a series of technical countermeasures. \n",
      "It is as much about people as it is  about  anything else. People have to be educated, \n",
      "motivated and appropriately regulated. The intention of this section is to provide the \n",
      "reader with the basic knowledge to understand how people and organisations should \n",
      "be managed within a culture of assurance.\n",

      "made aware of the dangers, how relevant they are to them and their data, and how to \n",
      "use the systems to make sure that the information assets are protected. This is very, \n",

      "INFORMATION SECURITY MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES\n",
      "in Chapter 3, there should be an information security  policy document, signed by the \n",
      "chief executive or equivalent, which says words to the effect of:\n",
      "We take information security  and assurance very seriously and it is a high priority \n",
      "for us. It is the responsibility of everyone within the organisation to be security-\n",
      "conscious and to abide by our information security  policy and procedures when \n",
      "dealing with colleagues, suppliers and customers. If you are uncertain as to the \n",
      "correct course of action or are suspicious about a set of circumstances, your duty \n",
      "is to consult the information security  manager for advice.\n",
      "Rather than just pinning this to department notice boards, it needs to become part of \n",
      "the culture of the organisation, and this will only happen if those in senior management \n",
      "lead by example. Do not expect people to do as you say if you do not stick to your own \n",
      "rules. Be proactive in promulgating this culture throughout the organisation and keeping \n",
      "the topic fresh in people’s minds. Over 50 per cent of assurance incidents are caused by  \n",
      "the inappropriate actions of an organisation’s staff. Far more problems are caused by \n",
      "accident than  by malicious  intent . A security-conscious culture will reduce the number \n",
      "of incidents. Without it people will either not use the countermeasures or find ways \n",
      "round them. That increases risks or undoes the work done to manage them.\n",
      "Security awareness\n",
      "A large part of creating and maintaining this type of culture is a security awareness \n",
      "programme. It is no use telling people that ‘there is a risk to our organisation and its \n",
      "assets’. That means nothing to the majority of the staff; it has to be made interesting \n",
      "and it must be something to which they can relate. There should be a programme \n",
      "of training for all employees and it should be included as part of their induction \n",
      "training programme. Make sure that everyone is aware of the particular risks to \n",
      "your organisation – and why they are risks. This may include training in specific \n",
      "laws and industry regulations that apply to your organisation. Give them examples of \n",
      "organisations that have suffered as a result of security incidents. If you can show them \n",
      "that the organisation will lose money or be prosecuted, it will mean something to them \n",
      "– it could affect their job security.\n",
      "It is also important to make people aware that this isn’t just about confidentiality. \n",
      "Introduce them to integrity and availability too. In today’s fast-moving business world \n",
      "it is often around these two aspects that greater problems can occur and have a much \n",
      "more significant effect.\n",
      "If possible, keep a record of assurance awareness training – who, when and what. It \n",
      "has several uses. First, it allows you to identify when refresher training is required, for \n",
      "example due to the passage of time or changes to risks or the law. Second, it could prove \n",
      "very useful in the event of legal action by helping to prove due diligence.\n",

      "entry. Users should only be granted the minimum level of privilege to perform the role \n",
      "assigned to them. For example , a person working in a warehouse may need access to \n",
      "the stock records, but they should not have access to the detailed financial or personnel \n",
      "records of an organisation. They simply do not need to know. The concept of ‘need to \n",
      "know’  is very important. We have already described how over 50 per cent of attacks \n",
      "originate from within the organisation; this is another line of defence to help in securing \n",
      "information. There is also the issue of privacy of data and legislation , such as the Data \n",
      "Protection Act , to be taken into consideration.\n",
      "In order to make this limitation possible we need to assign attributes to users and to \n",
      "data, describing their profile to the remainder of the systems. This information can then \n",
      "be used to control access to data and systems, providing another level of protection for \n",
      "data and users.\n",
      "The first concept to grant role-based access is that of user groups. Those users who \n",
      "perform a similar function are grouped together (for example accounts, sales, IT and \n",
      "so on). This  system  can be used to control access to applications or functionality within \n",
      "large integrated applications such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. An \n",
      "example of this could be that access to the payroll system is only permitted for finance \n",
      "and human resources group users. A user can be denoted as being a member of more \n",
      "than one group if their role(s) requires it. This type of designation may be based on some \n",
      "other attribute such as geographical location. All users in country A will have access to \n",
      "the data relevant to their own country , but no access to the data of country B and vice \n",
      "versa.\n",
      "One other kind of user account we must mention is that of the system or application \n",
      "administrator. This role has access not just to the data (quite often all of it), but also to \n",
      "the software and operating system itself. The ‘sysadmins’ can add and delete users, \n",
      "groups or levels of privilege, rebuild the system, erase data, grant or deny access to \n",
      "applications, change passwords and even alter or destroy event logging or auditing data. \n",
      "These accounts have great power and wide-ranging capabilities and their use must be \n",
      "tightly controlled and safeguarded. Their potential to disrupt operations, accidental or \n",
      "otherwise, is enormous.\n",
      "This degree of protection can be extended to the data as well. The standard approach is \n",
      "that there are three levels of privilege:\n",
      " yeach file has a designated owner, who has full control of the file;\n",
      " yother members of the same user group as the owner, who may have some \n",
      "degree of access as described below;\n",
      " ythe ‘rest of the world’, that is other users in other groups, who may also have \n",
      "some limited access as described below.\n",
      "There is another level of granularity that can be provided, which is to say whether the \n",
      "user can do the following:\n",
      " yRead – the user can see the contents of the file or database, but not change them.\n",
      " yWrite – the user can change the contents of the file or database. This includes \n",
      "deletion privilege, since the user can overwrite the data to destroy it.\n",

      " yUser/Owner – Execute permission, allowing the file owner to read, write and \n",

      " yGroup – Write permission, allowing other members of the same user group to \n",
      "update the file.\n",

      "Administration of controls\n",
      "The administration of access controls is another of the important jigsaw pieces that \n",
      "make up the whole picture. Their use at the appropriate time is essential. The levels of \n",
      "privilege that each user or administrator has should be reviewed and updated regularly. \n",
      "This takes into account the fact that people change role (for example get promoted or \n",
      "transfer to another team). New privileges  that are  needed should be granted, but those \n",
      "that are no longer required (for example old group memberships) should be removed.\n",
      "The role of the administrator should include the following :\n",
      " yEnrolling new users in the system after appropriate validation of identity. \n",
      "Without access they cannot do any work.\n",
      " yRemoving user access rights when they leave the organisation to prevent any \n",
      "further access.\n",
      " yModifying user access rights if they change role within the organisation. They \n",
      "may not be able to perform their new role without a change in rights, and they \n",
      "may no longer need access to data they previously accessed.\n",
      "People who leave the organisation should have their accounts deleted and all rights \n",
      "removed on the day they leave. Ownership of any data assets should be transferred to \n",
      "another user.\n",
      "Role-based access is an issue that often gets overlooked. The roles of system or \n",
      "database administrator (very high system privilege required) and those of standard \n",
      "user must not be combined into a single account. The lack of high-level privileges is \n",
      "a good security countermeasure. The separation of these roles provides protection \n",
      "against accidental and deliberate abuse of the system. It also ensures a higher quality \n",
      "audit trail. In some industry sectors , there is a legal requirement  to separate out not just \n",

      "PROCEDURAL AND PEOPLE SECURITY CONTROLS\n",
      "If the size of the organisation is such that the same individual is required to perform \n",
      "more than one duty, often within the IT department, then the segregation of duties must \n",
      "still be enforced. This can be achieved through the requirement to log in using a different \n",
      "account with the appropriate privileges when performing different duties. Whilst this \n",
      "may seem bureaucratic, it provides an effective audit trail and also helps to reinforce \n",
      "the serious nature of information security . There must always be someone else (another \n",
      "individual either internal or, as a last resort, external) who is used to audit the work of \n",
      "the main ‘sysadmin’ function.\n",
      "There can be occasions when access is needed to other areas of the system in order \n",
      "to meet an unusual or temporary operational requirement (for example to cover for a \n",
      "colleague on leave). There should be a process  in place  for users to apply for additional \n",
      "privileges to be granted temporarily so they can do the work. The approval should \n",
      "specify a start and end date for these, and those dates should be rigidly enforced.\n",
      "These procedures must also be applied to any temporary staff who work for the \n",
      "organisation. A regular check should be made for obsolete roles, user accounts and \n",
      "privileges to guard against any lapses in the process.\n",
      "Access points\n",
      "An access point is any location from which the internal systems of the organisation can \n",
      "be accessed. This can be via one of three main types:\n",
      " ydirect connection from a hard-wired terminal;\n",
      " ywireless network access within the perimeter;\n",
      " yremote access over a third-party network, such as a web client, broadband from \n",
      "home or dial-up from a hotel.\n",
      "There are two main security concerns with giving access:\n",
      "1. to ensure that the user completes the ID&A process successfully;\n",
      "2. to protect the data being used to complete the authentication process and \n",
      "then the session itself.\n",
      "If a user is connecting from a hard-wired terminal , then they are probably located within \n",
      "the premises of the organisation. This provides a degree of physical security to manage \n",
      "the risk that the person sat at the terminal is not an authorised user. The main risk \n",
      "is that someone is watching the user either visually or electronically with a ‘network \n",
      "sniffer’ or key-logger to capture the ID&A data. It is best to make sure that the login \n",
      "session is encrypted as it passes across the network in order to stop the data from \n",
      "being re-used to impersonate the user later.\n",
      "Remote access  presents additional challenges of physical and network security. It is \n",
      "quite likely that the network connection used is not controlled by the same organisation. \n",
      "This means it is even more important to protect not just the ID&A traffic, but all the data. \n",
      "This is usually achieved by setting higher requirements for ID&A, such  as two-factor \n",
      "authentication using tokens  as described earlier, and protecting the data connection  \n",

      "The latest challenge is created by the rise in popularity of wireless networks . These \n",
      "have a lot of advantages, primarily large savings in cabling costs, but they also have \n",
      "disadvantages, mainly to do with security. The radio waves do not stop at the physical \n",
      "perimeter of the organisation or house. They travel outside and allow unauthorised \n",
      "access to attackers if not properly configured and located in the network architecture. \n",
      "Readily available aerials mean that a determined attacker can connect from a range of \n",
      "several miles rather than being sat outside in a car, which would be fairly easy to spot. \n",
      "If they are in a nearby building (for example your neighbour or another hotel room) they \n",
      "can be almost impossible to spot. Wireless access points must be strictly controlled \n",
      "in terms of installation, configuration and their physical links to the network. Many \n",
      "organisations connect them into their ‘DMZ’ (demilitarised zone) on the network, so \n",
      "that users have to authenticate to a higher standard and their traffic is screened by a \n",

      " ydata on WiFi and radio frequency networks;\n",
      " yphysical – some devices may have a protective marking because of their design \n",
      "or content;\n",
      " yemail, texts and related social media such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter.\n",
      "All of these are considered to be information assets and thought must be given to \n",
      "their value to the organisation. This is not limited to their immediate commercial value, \n",
      "for example the design for a new product, but also the impact they could have on the \n",
      "organisation or other people if their contents were to become known to a competitor, \n",
      "foreign country or the public. The impacts can range from ‘negligible’ through to a ‘grave \n",

      "Once values have been assigned, a set of rules for handling and distribution must be \n",

      "as the ‘need-to-know’ principle – information should not be made available to people \n",
      "who do not need to know it. The fewer people that are aware of the knowledge, the \n",
      "easier that knowledge is to protect. However, this also presents a challenge in that \n",
      "enough people need to know to make best use of the information. There are even \n",
      "regulations in place to control the distribution of knowledge in some organisations. For \n",
      "example in finance the concept of the ‘Chinese wall’ is used to guard against conflicts \n",
      "of commercial interest and insider dealing of shares. The trick is understanding where \n",
      "the ideal balance point lies for each piece or type of data.\n",
      "Each level of classification requires protection appropriate to the value it has or, more \n",
      "accurately, the impact its inappropriate release or knowledge would have on the \n",
      "organisation or individual. The controls will not be just physical, but procedural and people-\n",
      "related too. Data of the ‘internal only’ variety is probably sufficiently well protected by the \n",
      "normal ID&A mechanism for the system, the standard business rules and the locks on \n",
      "the doors of the building. Data that is top secret is often required to be kept in very strong \n",

      "sample of around 10 per cent of the ﬁrms certiﬁcated by the time of the study. The\n",
      "survey found that the IT Services and software development sector is the primary\n",
      "adopter of ISO 27001 worldwide, with just one quarter of all certiﬁcations in the\n",
      "survey. Of these, just over half (52 per cent) are classed as IT security consultants. Of\n",
      "certiﬁcations 14 per cent were public sector, typically IT departments of larger\n",
      "organisations.\n",
      "The survey found that 50 per cent of the certiﬁcated organisations who responded,\n",
      "had under 200 employees, and therefore in the SME category. Perhaps moresurprisingly, around half of these had less than 50 employees.\n",
      "The survey found that 80 per cent of organisations sought certiﬁcation to ISO 27001\n",
      "as a means of gaining competitive advantage, with a lowly 28 per cent who had been\n",
      "required to gain certiﬁcation as a condition of tendering for business, and in 16 per cent\n",
      "of cases certiﬁcation had been a mandatory requirement of a customer.\n",
      "The reality may be less clear cut, as competitive advantage may derive from the\n",

      "Costs appear to vary but a common theme was the use of consultants with an averagecost of £22,000. Whilst this ﬁgure is of limited value because of the wide range in sizeof the respondent companies, it does suggest that cost may be a barrier for many. Evenamongst this group, 7 per cent stated that they would not use consultants, oralternatively reduce their reliance upon external resources if they were to implementthe system again. It is suggested that poor consultancy support does not result in thetransfer or establishment of a knowledge base within the client organisation. When thecertiﬁcation process is complete, the knowledge gained with the consultant and staffwithin the organisation lack ownership or understanding of the new system.\n",
      "Fomin et al. (2008) use the longer experience of ISO9001 and ISO14001 certiﬁcation to\n",

      "direct beneﬁts from the effective use of the quality management system itself.\n",
      "Backhouse et al. (2006, pp. 425-427) suggest that whilst this may be true in some\n",
      "cases for ISO/IEC27001, in the countries with the largest number of certiﬁcates forISO/IEC 27001 the certiﬁcation process is driven by either government regulation, as inJapan or supplier/buyer demands or the necessity of outsourcing and offshoring inmarkets such as Taiwan, Singapore and India.\n",

      "demonstrating to partners that the company has identiﬁed and measured their securityrisks and implemented a security policy and controls that will mitigate these risks Inaddition, international invitations to tender are beginning to require that organizationsbe compliant with certain security standards, and security audit demands fromﬁnancial institutions and insurance companies are increasing. A further incentive islower insurance premiums for ISO 27001 certiﬁed companies (von Solms and vonSolms, 2005).\n",
